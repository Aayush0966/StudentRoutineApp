# Student Routine App

College class schedules in PDFs are hard to read. I made this Expo app to show my classes in a clear, easy way.

## Features
- Shows classes in a simple layout
- Works on any device with Expo
- Easy to use

## How to Start
1. Get the code from this repo
2. Run `npm install` to set it up
3. Start the app with `npx expo start`

## Why I Made It
PDF schedules are annoying. This app makes it easy to see my classes without the struggle.
